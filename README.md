# [Quiz App](https://quirky-yalow-460c46.netlify.app/)

A simple quiz App built with TypeScript, React, Styled Components and the [Open Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/).

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

- Allow user to choose difficulty of quiz
- Issue with local image not loading without //@ts-ignore
- Issue with parser not accessing types appropriately --- I will need to create a separate component that touches the DOM directly I think
- Review [best practices](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-with-typescript-best-practices/)
